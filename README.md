# AI in Action

Exploring the differences between Copilots, SDKs, and Agentic solutions, and learn how each can be leveraged to enhance productivity and innovation. In this repo, we will explore four different techniques to work on the following user story:

## User story

As a user I want to use AI to help me write or rewrite KQL queries.

## Foundational LLM concepts

- Token: A unit of text (like a word or character) used in natural language processing. Most charges are based on Tokens. A prompt can do more than one thing.
- Inference: The process of making predictions or decisions based on a trained AI model.
- Prompt: The input text given to an AI model to generate a response.
- Completion: The output text generated by an AI model in response to a prompt.
- Prompt Engineering: The technique of designing and refining prompts to elicit desired responses from AI models.
  - Prompt engineering techniques:
    - Zero shot (no examples)
    - Few shot (one ore more examples)
    - Reference: [Prompt engineering techniques](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques)
- Context: The surrounding information or text that helps an AI model understand and generate relevant responses.
- Models:
  - Instruct Models: These are tailored for task-specific instructions, excelling at generating precise outputs based on clear directives, such as data summarization or translation.
  - Chat Models: These are optimized for conversational interactions, facilitating dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues, making them ideal for virtual assistants and customer service bots1.
    - System: Sets the behavior and guidelines for the interaction.
    - User: Represents the individual interacting with the AI.
    - Assistant: The AI model that responds to the user's queries and tasks.

## The rules

1. Calling the LLM is simple, what is difficult is everything else.
2. Always start in the playground.
3. It is not what the LLM knows, it is what you give it.
4. Prompt can be though of a semantic programs.
5. In Chat models, managing cotext messages is key in many solutions.


## Copilot Solution

The Office copilots are sophisticated intent engines. A Copilot will first analyze your prompt, determine what tasks in needs to execute (like getting data or calling a weather services), and executing the tasks.

```text
Prompt:
Given the following tables schemas:

Table: Events, Fields: eventID, type, userId, description, ts
Table: Users, Fields: userID, name, email
Type: infra,change,code

Write a Kusto query to find all the infra events in the last hour. Include the user's name and email in the result.

Completion content:

Events
| where type == "infra" and ts >= ago(1h)
| join kind=inner (
    Users
) on userId
| project eventID, type, description, ts, name, email
```

```text
system:
You are an AI that can generate Kusto queries. Use the following information to generate the queries:

Cluster: logcluster.contoso.kusto.net, Table: Events, Fields: eventID, type, userId, description, ts
Cluster: directory.contoso.kusto.net, Table: Users, Fields: userID, name, email, Type: infra,change,code

If the schema includes a cluster name, use the following query format:
cluster("logcluster.company.net").database("database_name").Events | where ts >= ago(1h)

No epilogue or prologue.

user:
Write a Kusto query to find all the infra events in the last hour. Include the user's name and email in the result.

Completion content:

Events
| where type == "infra" and ts >= ago(1h)
| join kind=inner (
    Users
) on userId
| project eventID, type, description, ts, name, email
```
